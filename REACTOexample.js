// Prompt: Print integers one-to-N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by three, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by five, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both three and five



//NOTE: FizzBuzz is a common interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of candidates!

//Remember the REACTO method:

function fizzBuzz (n) {
    let wordPrint += ';'
    let numPrint = 1

    //let n 
    if (n % 3 === 0) {

    }
    //if n is divisible by 3, contact fizz
    
    //if n is divisible by 5, concact Buzz
    
    //else print n

}  

console.log(fizzBuzz(15))
